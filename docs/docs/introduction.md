## Personas

### Customer

- **Retailer**: A retailer is a business or individual that sells goods or services directly to consumers for personal or household use. They typically operate from physical stores, online platforms, or both, and may purchase products from wholesalers or manufacturers to resell to end customers at a markup. Retailers play a crucial role in the distribution chain by providing access to products and services for consumers.

- **Customer**: A customer is an individual or organization that purchases goods or services from a retailer. Customers are the lifeblood of any retail business, as they provide the revenue needed to sustain operations and grow the business. Customers have a wide range of needs, preferences, and expectations when it comes to shopping, and retailers must work hard to meet and exceed these expectations to attract and retain customers.
