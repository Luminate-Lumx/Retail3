</div>

## Overview 📝

**Retail3** is a decentralized retail platform that leverages the use of the [Lumx API](https://docs.lumx.io/get-started/introduction) to provide for **abstracting the complexities of blockchain technology** and enabling retailers to **offer benefits/cashback to customers in a simple and secure way**. The platform aims enjoy of the **benefits of blockchain technology, such as transparency, security, and decentralization**, to create a seamless shopping experience for customers and retailers alike 🛒.

A key innovation of **Retail3** is its transformative loyalty program, which redefines the management and distribution of rewards in the retail sector. This program operates on an **accumulative pool system, where rewards are distributed based on customer loyalty scores**. This approach not only **incentivizes continuous engagement** but also ensures a **fair and transparent reward system**, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Key Problems solved 🚀

-   **Lack of Transparency** 🕵️‍♂️: Retailers often struggle to provide customers with accurate, up-to-date information about products, prices, and promotions. This solution provides real-time data that helps customers make informed decisions and shop with confidence.
-   **Limited Rewards** 🎁: Customers are often disappointed by the limited rewards and incentives offered by retailers. Retail3 provides a rewards program that encourages customers to shop smart and earn cashback on their purchases based on their loyalty scores and contributions to the rewards pool.
-   **Security Concerns** 🔒: Customers are increasingly concerned about the security of their personal and financial information when shopping online. Retail3 uses blockchain technology to provide a secure, decentralized platform that protects customer data and ensures trust and transparency in the retail ecosystem.
-   **Complexity of Blockchain** 🧩: Retailers are often intimidated by the complexity of blockchain technology and are hesitant to adopt it in their operations. The [Lumx API](https://docs.lumx.io/get-started/introduction) simplifies this, providing a user-friendly platform that retailers can easily integrate into their existing systems.
-   **Lack of Customer Engagement** 💬: Retailers struggle to engage customers and build loyalty in an increasingly competitive market. Retail3's rewards program incentivizes shopping at participating retailers and sharing experiences, driving engagement and repeat business.
-   **Inefficient Loyalty Programs** 🔄: Retailers often rely on outdated, inefficient loyalty programs that fail to deliver value to customers. Retail3's transformative loyalty program rewards customers based on their loyalty scores, encouraging continuous engagement and enhancing satisfaction.

## Technologies

-   **Lumx API** 🟣: We are using the [Lumx API](https://docs.lumx.io/get-started/introduction) is a powerful tool that allows developers to interact with the blockchain and build decentralized applications. By using the Lumx API, we are able to create a secure, transparent platform that provides real-time data.
-   **Web3 Providers** 🌐: We are using Web3 providers to interact with the blockchain and access view only functions of contracts.
-   **Lumx-Node** 📦: We created a package to wrap all the functions of [Lumx API](https://docs.lumx.io/get-started/introduction) and Web3 view functions, you can find more about in [lumx-node package](https://github.com/Luminate-Lumx/lumx-node).
-   **Node.js with React** 🚀: We are using Node.js with React to build the front-end of the platform. React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Node.js is a runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript on the server.
-   **Solidity with Scaffold-eth2/Hardhat** 🛠️: We are using Solidity with Scaffold-eth2 to build the smart contracts that power the platform. Solidity is a programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, and Scaffold-eth2 is a development environment that provides tools and templates for building decentralized applications.
-   **IPFS** 🌐: We are using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to store and distribute data on the platform. IPFS is a peer-to-peer protocol that allows us to store files in a decentralized manner, making it easy to access and share data across the network.
-   **Docker** 🐳: We are using Docker to containerize the application and deploy it in a consistent and reproducible manner. Docker allows us to package the application and its dependencies into a container that can be run on any platform, making it easy to deploy and scale the platform.

## User Journey 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️

Here is a user journey map that illustrates the key steps involved in using the project platform from the perspective of a customer and a retailer. This map highlights the key touchpoints, interactions, and outcomes that occur at each stage of the user journey, from initial discovery to final purchase.

## Personas 🎭

For this project, we have identified two main personas: the **retailer** and the **customer**. These personas represent the key stakeholders in the retail industry and are essential to understanding the needs and expectations of users on the project.

### Customer

A customer is an individual or organization that purchases goods or services from a retailer. Customers are the lifeblood of any retail business, as they provide the revenue needed to sustain operations and grow the business. Customers have a wide range of needs, preferences, and expectations when it comes to shopping, and retailers must work hard to meet and exceed these expectations to attract and retain customers.

### Retailer

A retailer is a business or individual that sells goods or services directly to consumers for personal or household use. They typically operate from physical stores, online platforms, or both, and may purchase products from wholesalers or manufacturers to resell to end customers at a markup. Retailers play a crucial role in the distribution chain by providing access to products and services for consumers.

By understanding the needs, preferences, and expectations of these personas, we can design a platform that meets their needs and provides value to both customers and retailers. Below you can see the personas in more detail:
